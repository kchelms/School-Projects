API Search Query Example

localhost:3000/search/?yr[]=2016&gc[]=ACTOR&e[]=Jack+Nicholson&w=1

year query 			-- yr[]={whatever year}
category query 		-- c[]={whatever category}
general_cat query 	-- gc[]={whatever general_cat}
entity query 		-- e[]={whatever entity}
winner query    	-- w={1 or 0}

These query statements can be placed in any order in your url. If you're searching for multiples of whatever key, just make multiple queries i.e. :


localhost:3000/search/?gc[]=ACTOR&gc[]=PICTURE

Multiple years - same thing, but only the first and last years:

localhost:3000/search/?yr[]=2016&yr[]=2019

List of queries must start with "?" and each must be separated by "&"


API ID Query Example

localhost:3000/?ID={Whatever ID#}
