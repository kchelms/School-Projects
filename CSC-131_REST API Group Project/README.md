<h1>REST API - Group Project</h1>

<p>
    This project was developed as a part of an intro to software engineering course as a way to practice software 
    engineering practices as a team. As a team of five, we ran through the process, from initial design to 
    implementation using Agile (SCRUM) methodology.
